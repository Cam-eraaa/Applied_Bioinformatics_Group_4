Probably specific to larval innate immunity (PubMed:22022271). Involved in the tracheal immune response of larvae to Gram-negative and perhaps Gram-positive bacteria; upon infection it negatively regulates the immune deficiency (Imd) signaling cascade specifically in the respiratory epithelium to prevent the overexpression of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) (PubMed:22022271).

Integrin alpha-PS2/beta-PS is a receptor for Tig, wb and Ten-m (PubMed:7924982, PubMed:7972082, PubMed:9660786). Contributes to endodermal integrity and adhesion between the midgut epithelium and the surrounding visceral muscle (PubMed:15469969). Essential for migration of the primordial midgut cells and for maintaining, but not establishing, cell polarity in the midgut epithelium (PubMed:15469969).
