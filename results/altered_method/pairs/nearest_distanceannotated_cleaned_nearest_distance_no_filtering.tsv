Region703	FBgn0003326	3073	Toll9 Up	12.3665289877411	P21520	Protein scabrous	sca	<ul><li>Involved in regulation of neurogenesis. May encode a lateral inhibitor of R8 differentiation. In conjunction with Gp150, promotes Notch activation in response to Delta by regulating acquisition of insensitivity to Delta in a subset of cells.</ul>
Region710	FBgn0053182	3450	Toll9 Up	10.8507767398371	Q9V6L0	Probable lysine-specific demethylase 4B	Kdm4B	<ul><li>Probable histone demethylase that specifically demethylates 'Lys-9' and 'Lys-36' residues of histone H3, thereby playing a central role in histone code. Demethylation of Lys residue generates formaldehyde and succinate (By similarity).</ul>
Region710	FBgn0085408	2200	Toll9 Up	13.5659163856045	A1Z9P3	Protein Shroom	Shrm	<ul><li>Binds to Rho-kinase Rok and targets it to the apical cell cortex where it mediates apical constriction (PubMed:20549743, PubMed:22493320). During embryogenic axis elongation, required for the localization to adherens junctions and the establishment of planar polarization of both Rho-kinase Rok and myosin regulatory light chain sqh (PubMed:24535826). May be involved in the assembly of microtubule arrays during cell elongation (By similarity).</ul>
