Acts as a morphogen during embryogenesis to pattern the dorsal/ventral axis, specifying dorsal ectoderm and amnioserosa cell fate within the dorsal half of the embryo; this activity is antagonized by binding to sog and tsg. Induces the formation of visceral mesoderm and the heart in early embryos. Required later in embryogenesis for dorsal closure and patterning of the hindgut. Also functions postembryonically as a long-range morphogen during imaginal disk development; is responsible for the progression of the morphogenetic furrow during eye development.

In connecting cells they preferentially interact with themselves in a homophilic manner; cadherins may thus contribute to the sorting of heterogeneous cell types (PubMed:7958432). During oogenesis, integral component of the guidance mechanisms that regulate the directional persistent collective migration of the border cell (BC) cluster through the nurse cells to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317). Functions downstream of the two chemoattractant receptors, Pvr and Egfr, to promote BC adhesion between the leader cells of the migrating cluster and the surrounding nurse cells (PubMed:24855950). This adhesion increases Rac1 signaling in the leading cells, which in turn stabilizes DE-cadherin/DE-cadherin adhesions through the formation of forward-directed protrusions which attach/detach to the surrounding nurse cells in order to pull the cluster through the egg chamber to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950). Within the BC cluster, also promotes adhesion between BCs, and between BCs and polar cells which enables the lead BC to communicate direction to the other cells in the cluster, providing polarity to each individual cell and ensuring collective behavior (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317). May function in cell intercalation in the lateral epidermis during germband extension (PubMed:24681004).

The reaction with UDP-Gal plays a critical role in the Leloir pathway of galactose catabolism in which galactose is converted to the glycolytic intermediate glucose 6-phosphate. It contributes to the catabolism of dietary galactose and enables the endogenous biosynthesis of both UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc when exogenous sources are limited (PubMed:22654673).

In various developing tissues functions as a cell cycle regulator that mediates cell proliferation according to the requirements of the developmental program (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871). Acts by inducing the proteasomal degradation of the CD25 mitotic activators stg and twe at critical stages of development to delay entry into mitosis and thus mediate cell proliferation (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871, PubMed:23290551, PubMed:29025897). During gastrulation, negatively regulates stg to delay mitosis in the ventral region of the embryonic mesoderm thus allowing invagination to be completed before cell division takes place (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494). Delaying stg-dependent mitosis during bristle development and in migrating germline pole cells also arrests their cell divisions, whereas in cystocytes it promotes their cell divisions (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:15581871). Involved in the regulation of the mid-blastula transition; promotes the destruction of twe resulting in the cell cycle arrest in G2 of cycle 14 which delays mitosis and thus reduces cell proliferation allowing cell fate specification and morphogenesis to take place (PubMed:23290551).

Acts with exd to delimit the eye field and prevent inappropriate eye development. Isoforms that carry the homeodomain are required for proper localization of chordotonal organs within the peripheral nervous system and antennal identity; required to activate antennal-specific genes, such as sal and to repress the leg-like expression of dac. Necessary for the nuclear localization of the essential HOX cofactor, extradenticle (exd). Both necessary and sufficient for inner photoreceptors to adopt the polarization-sensitive 'dorsal rim area' (DRA) of the eye fate instead of the color-sensitive default state. This occurs by increasing rhabdomere size and uncoupling R7-R8 communication to allow both cells to express the same opsin rather than different ones as required for color vision.</ul>

Could function as a secreted signal to initiate apical constriction by acting as a ligand for an unidentified G protein-coupled receptor, which in turn activates the G protein alpha subunit encoded by concertina, in neighboring cells. Such an intracellular pathway would ultimately induce contraction of the apical actin-myosin network. In the ventral furrow, fog appears to ensure that all the cells initiate constriction within several minutes of each other. In the posterior midgut invagination, fog appears to direct the ordered progression of constriction initiations out from a central region and also to delimit the peripheral extent of this spreading.</ul>
