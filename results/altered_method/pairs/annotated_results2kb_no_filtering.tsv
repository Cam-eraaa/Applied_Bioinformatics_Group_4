Induces the formation of visceral mesoderm and the heart in early embryos. Required later in embryogenesis for dorsal closure and patterning of the hindgut. Also functions postembryonically as a long-range morphogen during imaginal disk development; is responsible for the progression of the morphogenetic furrow during eye development. Patterns the wing imaginal disk along its anterior/posterior axis and has a role in positioning pro-veins. Also required to subdivide the wing disk along the proximal/distal axis into body wall (notum) and wing. Ensures the correct architecture of wing epithelial cells. Has multiple roles in the developing tracheal system, controlling directed tracheal cell migration during embryogenesis and later specifying the fate of fusion cells in the tracheal branches. Required for viability of larvae. Essential for the maintenance and division of germline stem cells in the ovary. Signals via the type I receptor tkv, the type II receptor punt, and in some tissues via the type I receptor sax, in a signaling cascade that leads to activation and repression of target genes.</ul>

Most of frizzled receptors are coupled to the beta-catenin canonical signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of disheveled proteins, inhibition of GSK-3 kinase, nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Wnt target genes. A second signaling pathway involving PKC and calcium fluxes has been seen for some family members, but it is not yet clear if it represents a distinct pathway or if it can be integrated in the canonical pathway, as PKC seems to be required for Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK-3 kinase. Both pathways seem to involve interactions with G-proteins. Required to coordinate the cytoskeletons of epidermal cells to produce a parallel array of cuticular hairs and bristles.</ul>

Integrin alpha-PS2/beta-PS is a receptor for Tig, wb and Ten-m (PubMed:7924982, PubMed:7972082, PubMed:9660786). Contributes to endodermal integrity and adhesion between the midgut epithelium and the surrounding visceral muscle (PubMed:15469969). Essential for migration of the primordial midgut cells and for maintaining, but not establishing, cell polarity in the midgut epithelium (PubMed:15469969). The two beta subunits mediate midgut migration by distinct mechanisms: beta-PS requires rhea/talin and Itgbn does not (PubMed:15469969). Required for rhea/talin correct cellular localization in the midgut (PubMed:15469969). Required for many embryonic (dorsal closure and somatic muscle attachments) and postembryonic developmental processes (attachment between cell layers of imaginal disks, organization of ommatidial arrays and flight muscle development) (PubMed:8119134, PubMed:7924982, PubMed:7972082, PubMed:10821184). Involved in the function and/or development of the olfactory system (PubMed:10821184). In the testes, essential for shv-dependent maintenance of somatic hub cells and their localization to the apical tip (PubMed:27191715).
