The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823, PubMed:25512509). The function of GATOR1 in negatively regulating the TORC1 pathway is essential for maintaining baseline levels of TORC1 activity under nutrient rich conditions, and for promoting survival during amino acid or complete starvation by inhibiting TORC1-dependent cell growth and promoting catabolic metabolism and autophagy (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823). In addition, this inhibition of TORC1 is necessary to maintain female fertility under normal conditions and during periods of nutrient stress (PubMed:24786828, PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509). After exactly four mitotic cyst divisions, the GATOR1 complex members (Iml1, Nprl2 and Nprl3) down-regulate TORC1 to slow cellular metabolism and promote the mitotic/meiotic transition (PubMed:25512509). At later stages of oogenesis, the mio and Nup44A components of the GATOR2 complex inhibit GATOR1 and thus activate TORC1 to promote meiotic progression, and drive oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509).</ul>

Functions by binding to key regulatory proteins and either blocks their activity or regulates their turnover by the proteasome (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10949024, PubMed:23305818, PubMed:25329475). In various developing tissues functions as a cell cycle regulator that mediates cell proliferation according to the requirements of the developmental program (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871). Acts by inducing the proteasomal degradation of the CD25 mitotic activators stg and twe at critical stages of development to delay entry into mitosis and thus mediate cell proliferation (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871, PubMed:23290551, PubMed:29025897). During gastrulation, negatively regulates stg to delay mitosis in the ventral region of the embryonic mesoderm thus allowing invagination to be completed before cell division takes place (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494). Delaying stg-dependent mitosis during bristle development and in migrating germline pole cells also arrests their cell divisions, whereas in cystocytes it promotes their cell divisions (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:15581871). Involved in the regulation of the mid-blastula transition; promotes the destruction of twe resulting in the cell cycle arrest in G2 of cycle 14 which delays mitosis and thus reduces cell proliferation allowing cell fate specification and morphogenesis to take place (PubMed:23290551). In germline cells, blocks border cell migration during oogenesis by binding to slbo/C/EBP and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:23305818, PubMed:10949024, PubMed:29025897). May function in a negative feedback loop with slbo to coordinate proper border cell migration (PubMed:23305818). During tissue growth negatively regulates insulin signaling by binding to Akt1 and blocking its phosphorylation-dependent activation (PubMed:25329475, PubMed:29025897). However it may also function downstream in the insulin signaling pathway, acting with Akt1 to direct foxo degradation (PubMed:25329475). Essential for the proper formation of operant place and aversive olfactory memories (PubMed:18430923, PubMed:28669782).</ul>

Required presynaptically for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) neurotransmission. Inhibits neuronal BMP signaling by promoting endocytic internalization and subsequent endosomal trafficking of the BMP receptor wit. In this way, regulates the Fmr1 translational regulator controlling Futsch expression to modulate neuronal microtubule stability, which controls both synaptogenesis and neuronal survival.</ul>

Acts with exd to delimit the eye field and prevent inappropriate eye development. Isoforms that carry the homeodomain are required for proper localization of chordotonal organs within the peripheral nervous system and antennal identity; required to activate antennal-specific genes, such as sal and to repress the leg-like expression of dac. Necessary for the nuclear localization of the essential HOX cofactor, extradenticle (exd). Both necessary and sufficient for inner photoreceptors to adopt the polarization-sensitive 'dorsal rim area' (DRA) of the eye fate instead of the color-sensitive default state. This occurs by increasing rhabdomere size and uncoupling R7-R8 communication to allow both cells to express the same opsin rather than different ones as required for color vision.</ul>
