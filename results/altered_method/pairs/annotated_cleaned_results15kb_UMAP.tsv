Region4267	FBgn0036397	1945	Time Down	Time Up	Q9VUB4	GATOR complex protein NPRL3	Nprl3	<ul><li>An essential component of the GATOR subcomplex GATOR1 which functions as an inhibitor of the amino acid-sensing branch of the TORC1 signaling pathway (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823, PubMed:25512509). The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823, PubMed:25512509). The function of GATOR1 in negatively regulating the TORC1 pathway is essential for maintaining baseline levels of TORC1 activity under nutrient rich conditions, and for promoting survival during amino acid or complete starvation by inhibiting TORC1-dependent cell growth and promoting catabolic metabolism and autophagy (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823). In addition, this inhibition of TORC1 is necessary to maintain female fertility under normal conditions and during periods of nutrient stress (PubMed:24786828, PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509). After exactly four mitotic cyst divisions, the GATOR1 complex members (Iml1, Nprl2 and Nprl3) down-regulate TORC1 to slow cellular metabolism and promote the mitotic/meiotic transition (PubMed:25512509). At later stages of oogenesis, the mio and Nup44A components of the GATOR2 complex inhibit GATOR1 and thus activate TORC1 to promote meiotic progression, and drive oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509).</ul>

Functions by binding to key regulatory proteins and either blocks their activity or regulates their turnover by the proteasome (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10949024, PubMed:23305818, PubMed:25329475). In various developing tissues functions as a cell cycle regulator that mediates cell proliferation according to the requirements of the developmental program (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871). Acts by inducing the proteasomal degradation of the CD25 mitotic activators stg and twe at critical stages of development to delay entry into mitosis and thus mediate cell proliferation (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871, PubMed:23290551, PubMed:29025897). During gastrulation, negatively regulates stg to delay mitosis in the ventral region of the embryonic mesoderm thus allowing invagination to be completed before cell division takes place (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494). Delaying stg-dependent mitosis during bristle development and in migrating germline pole cells also arrests their cell divisions, whereas in cystocytes it promotes their cell divisions (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:15581871). Involved in the regulation of the mid-blastula transition; promotes the destruction of twe resulting in the cell cycle arrest in G2 of cycle 14 which delays mitosis and thus reduces cell proliferation allowing cell fate specification and morphogenesis to take place (PubMed:23290551). In germline cells, blocks border cell migration during oogenesis by binding to slbo/C/EBP and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:23305818, PubMed:10949024, PubMed:29025897). May function in a negative feedback loop with slbo to coordinate proper border cell migration (PubMed:23305818). During tissue growth negatively regulates insulin signaling by binding to Akt1 and blocking its phosphorylation-dependent activation (PubMed:25329475, PubMed:29025897). However it may also function downstream in the insulin signaling pathway, acting with Akt1 to direct foxo degradation (PubMed:25329475).
