During oogenesis, integral component of the guidance mechanisms that regulate the directional persistent collective migration of the border cell (BC) cluster through the nurse cells to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317). Functions downstream of the two chemoattractant receptors, Pvr and Egfr, to promote BC adhesion between the leader cells of the migrating cluster and the surrounding nurse cells (PubMed:24855950). This adhesion increases Rac1 signaling in the leading cells, which in turn stabilizes DE-cadherin/DE-cadherin adhesions through the formation of forward-directed protrusions which attach/detach to the surrounding nurse cells in order to pull the cluster through the egg chamber to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950). Within the BC cluster, also promotes adhesion between BCs, and between BCs and polar cells which enables the lead BC to communicate direction to the other cells in the cluster, providing polarity to each individual cell and ensuring collective behavior (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317). May function in cell intercalation in the lateral epidermis during germband extension (PubMed:24681004).
