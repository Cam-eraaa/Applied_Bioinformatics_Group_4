Acts as a morphogen during embryogenesis to pattern the dorsal/ventral axis, specifying dorsal ectoderm and amnioserosa cell fate within the dorsal half of the embryo; this activity is antagonized by binding to sog and tsg. Induces the formation of visceral mesoderm and the heart in early embryos. Required later in embryogenesis for dorsal closure and patterning of the hindgut. Also functions postembryonically as a long-range morphogen during imaginal disk development; is responsible for the progression of the morphogenetic furrow during eye development. Patterns the wing imaginal disk along its anterior/posterior axis and has a role in positioning pro-veins. Also required to subdivide the wing disk along the proximal/distal axis into body wall (notum) and wing. Ensures the correct architecture of wing epithelial cells. Has multiple roles in the developing tracheal system, controlling directed tracheal cell migration during embryogenesis and later specifying the fate of fusion cells in the tracheal branches. Required for viability of larvae. Essential for the maintenance and division of germline stem cells in the ovary. Signals via the type I receptor tkv, the type II receptor punt, and in some tissues via the type I receptor sax, in a signaling cascade that leads to activation and repression of target genes.</ul>

Isoforms that carry the homeodomain are required for proper localization of chordotonal organs within the peripheral nervous system and antennal identity; required to activate antennal-specific genes, such as sal and to repress the leg-like expression of dac. Necessary for the nuclear localization of the essential HOX cofactor, extradenticle (exd). Both necessary and sufficient for inner photoreceptors to adopt the polarization-sensitive 'dorsal rim area' (DRA) of the eye fate instead of the color-sensitive default state. This occurs by increasing rhabdomere size and uncoupling R7-R8 communication to allow both cells to express the same opsin rather than different ones as required for color vision.</ul>
