The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein Hippo (Hpo), in complex with its regulatory protein Salvador (Sav), phosphorylates and activates Warts (Wts) in complex with its regulatory protein Mats, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates the Yorkie (Yki) oncoprotein. Ex acts synergistically along with Mer and Kibra to regulate the Hippo signaling pathway (PubMed:20159598). Involved in the control of cell proliferation in imaginal disks (PubMed:8269855, PubMed:27462444).

Acts as a morphogen during embryogenesis to pattern the dorsal/ventral axis, specifying dorsal ectoderm and amnioserosa cell fate within the dorsal half of the embryo; this activity is antagonized by binding to sog and tsg. Induces the formation of visceral mesoderm and the heart in early embryos. Required later in embryogenesis for dorsal closure and patterning of the hindgut. Also functions postembryonically as a long-range morphogen during imaginal disk development; is responsible for the progression of the morphogenetic furrow during eye development. Patterns the wing imaginal disk along its anterior/posterior axis and has a role in positioning pro-veins. Also required to subdivide the wing disk along the proximal/distal axis into body wall (notum) and wing. Ensures the correct architecture of wing epithelial cells. Has multiple roles in the developing tracheal system, controlling directed tracheal cell migration during embryogenesis and later specifying the fate of fusion cells in the tracheal branches. Required for viability of larvae. Essential for the maintenance and division of germline stem cells in the ovary. Signals via the type I receptor tkv, the type II receptor punt, and in some tissues via the type I receptor sax, in a signaling cascade that leads to activation and repression of target genes.</ul>

In contrast, hyperphosphorylated form dissociates from eIF4E1, allowing interaction between eIF4G1 and eIF4E1, leading to initiation of translation (PubMed:25702871). Acts as a regulator of various biological processes, such as innate immunity, cell growth or synaptic transmission (PubMed:10811906, PubMed:11389445, PubMed:27525480). Acts downstream of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) to regulate cell growth (PubMed:11389445). Extends lifespan upon dietary restriction by regulating the mitochondrial translation (PubMed:19804760).

Probably recruited by other proteins to repress translation of other mRNAs in other tissues (PubMed:11274060). Involved in the regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis and cell growth (PubMed:11807032). Participates in abdominal segmentation and imaginal disk development (PubMed:11274060). During neuroblast division, segregates asymmetrically and inhibits self-renewal of one of the two daughter cells (PubMed:16564014). Together with the asymmetrically segregating transcription factor prospero ensures that the daughter cell will stop growing, exit the cell cycle, and differentiate into neurons possibly by modulating the function of dm in ganglion mother cells (GMC) (PubMed:11807032, PubMed:16564014).

Functions downstream of the two chemoattractant receptors, Pvr and Egfr, to promote BC adhesion between the leader cells of the migrating cluster and the surrounding nurse cells (PubMed:24855950). This adhesion increases Rac1 signaling in the leading cells, which in turn stabilizes DE-cadherin/DE-cadherin adhesions through the formation of forward-directed protrusions which attach/detach to the surrounding nurse cells in order to pull the cluster through the egg chamber to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950). Within the BC cluster, also promotes adhesion between BCs, and between BCs and polar cells which enables the lead BC to communicate direction to the other cells in the cluster, providing polarity to each individual cell and ensuring collective behavior (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317).

The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823, PubMed:25512509). The function of GATOR1 in negatively regulating the TORC1 pathway is essential for maintaining baseline levels of TORC1 activity under nutrient rich conditions, and for promoting survival during amino acid or complete starvation by inhibiting TORC1-dependent cell growth and promoting catabolic metabolism and autophagy (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823). In addition, this inhibition of TORC1 is necessary to maintain female fertility under normal conditions and during periods of nutrient stress (PubMed:24786828, PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509). After exactly four mitotic cyst divisions, the GATOR1 complex members (Iml1, Nprl2 and Nprl3) down-regulate TORC1 to slow cellular metabolism and promote the mitotic/meiotic transition (PubMed:25512509). At later stages of oogenesis, the mio and Nup44A components of the GATOR2 complex inhibit GATOR1 and thus activate TORC1 to promote meiotic progression, and drive oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509).</ul>

Functions by binding to key regulatory proteins and either blocks their activity or regulates their turnover by the proteasome (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10949024, PubMed:23305818, PubMed:25329475). In various developing tissues functions as a cell cycle regulator that mediates cell proliferation according to the requirements of the developmental program (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871). Acts by inducing the proteasomal degradation of the CD25 mitotic activators stg and twe at critical stages of development to delay entry into mitosis and thus mediate cell proliferation (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871, PubMed:23290551, PubMed:29025897). During gastrulation, negatively regulates stg to delay mitosis in the ventral region of the embryonic mesoderm thus allowing invagination to be completed before cell division takes place (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494). Delaying stg-dependent mitosis during bristle development and in migrating germline pole cells also arrests their cell divisions, whereas in cystocytes it promotes their cell divisions (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:15581871). Involved in the regulation of the mid-blastula transition; promotes the destruction of twe resulting in the cell cycle arrest in G2 of cycle 14 which delays mitosis and thus reduces cell proliferation allowing cell fate specification and morphogenesis to take place (PubMed:23290551). In germline cells, blocks border cell migration during oogenesis by binding to slbo/C/EBP and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:23305818, PubMed:10949024, PubMed:29025897). May function in a negative feedback loop with slbo to coordinate proper border cell migration (PubMed:23305818). During tissue growth negatively regulates insulin signaling by binding to Akt1 and blocking its phosphorylation-dependent activation (PubMed:25329475, PubMed:29025897).

Could function as a secreted signal to initiate apical constriction by acting as a ligand for an unidentified G protein-coupled receptor, which in turn activates the G protein alpha subunit encoded by concertina, in neighboring cells. Such an intracellular pathway would ultimately induce contraction of the apical actin-myosin network. In the ventral furrow, fog appears to ensure that all the cells initiate constriction within several minutes of each other. In the posterior midgut invagination, fog appears to direct the ordered progression of constriction initiations out from a central region and also to delimit the peripheral extent of this spreading.</ul>
