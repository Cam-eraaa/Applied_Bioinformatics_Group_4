Required for segmental identity of the second through eighth abdominal segments. Once a pattern of abd-A expression is turned on in a given parasegment, it remains on the more posterior parasegment, so that the complex pattern of expression is built up in the successive parasegments. Appears to repress expression of Ubx whenever they appear in the same cell, but abd-A is repressed by Abd-B only in the eight and ninth abdominal segments.</ul>

Dbt reduces the stability and thus the accumulation of monomeric per proteins, probably through phosphorylation. No evident circadian oscillation is detected in head. Together with CkIalpha, regulates processing of ci by phosphorylating it which promotes its binding to slmb, the F-box recognition component of the SCF(slmb) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PubMed:16326393).</ul>

Integrin alpha-PS2/beta-PS is a receptor for Tig, wb and Ten-m (PubMed:7924982, PubMed:7972082, PubMed:9660786). Contributes to endodermal integrity and adhesion between the midgut epithelium and the surrounding visceral muscle (PubMed:15469969). Essential for migration of the primordial midgut cells and for maintaining, but not establishing, cell polarity in the midgut epithelium (PubMed:15469969). The two beta subunits mediate midgut migration by distinct mechanisms: beta-PS requires rhea/talin and Itgbn does not (PubMed:15469969). Required for rhea/talin correct cellular localization in the midgut (PubMed:15469969). Required for many embryonic (dorsal closure and somatic muscle attachments) and postembryonic developmental processes (attachment between cell layers of imaginal disks, organization of ommatidial arrays and flight muscle development) (PubMed:8119134, PubMed:7924982, PubMed:7972082, PubMed:10821184). Involved in the function and/or development of the olfactory system (PubMed:10821184). In the testes, essential for shv-dependent maintenance of somatic hub cells and their localization to the apical tip (PubMed:27191715). Plays a role in timely border cell migration during oogenesis (PubMed:19035354).</ul>

In the WMM complex, acts as a key regulator of m6A methylation by bridging fl(2)d to the RNA-binding component nito (PubMed:29535189). Required for sex determination and dosage compensation via Sxl alternative splicing: m6A methylation acts as a key regulator of Sxl pre-mRNA and promotes female-specific alternative splicing of Sxl, which determines female physiognomy (PubMed:29535189, PubMed:29555755).</ul>
