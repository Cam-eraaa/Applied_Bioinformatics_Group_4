Required for proper development of proximal leg segments. Has differential functions along the dorso-ventral axs of the antennal and leg disks. May play a role in wing hinge development. Possible involvement in chromatin structure for modulation of transcription. Binds DNA and can act as both a transcriptional repressor and activator. Positively regulates its own expression as well as that of Dll. Negatively regulates the expression of mod. Required for Wg-mediated transcriptional repression of Ubx in the midgut. Also represses transcription of lab in the midgut and is necessary for the proper formation of anterior and central midgut structures. Tiptop (tio) and teashirt (tsh) have, on the whole, common activities. Tio and tsh repress each other's expression and tsh has a crucial role for trunk patterning that is in part masked by ectopic expression of tiptop. Both genes share a common activity required for the activation of Ser and svb and the maintenance of en and wg.</ul>

Involved in the NF-kappa-B-dependent apoptosis of unfit cells during cell competition (PubMed:25477468). Involved in neuron-specific glycosylation (PubMed:12588858, PubMed:17264077). Positively controls the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) growth in presynaptic motorneurons, probably via the JNK pathway (PubMed:24662564).

The two beta subunits mediate midgut migration by distinct mechanisms: beta-PS requires rhea/talin and Itgbn does not (PubMed:15469969). Required for rhea/talin correct cellular localization in the midgut (PubMed:15469969). Required for many embryonic (dorsal closure and somatic muscle attachments) and postembryonic developmental processes (attachment between cell layers of imaginal disks, organization of ommatidial arrays and flight muscle development) (PubMed:8119134, PubMed:7924982, PubMed:7972082, PubMed:10821184). Involved in the function and/or development of the olfactory system (PubMed:10821184). In the testes, essential for shv-dependent maintenance of somatic hub cells and their localization to the apical tip (PubMed:27191715). Plays a role in timely border cell migration during oogenesis (PubMed:19035354).</ul>

The short isoform may be a more general cell adhesion molecule involved in other tissues and imaginal disk morphogenesis. Vital for embryonic development. Essential for septate junctions. Septate junctions, which are the equivalent of vertebrates tight junctions, are characterized by regular arrays of transverse structures that span the intermembrane space and form a physical barrier to diffusion. Required for the blood-brain barrier formation.</ul>
