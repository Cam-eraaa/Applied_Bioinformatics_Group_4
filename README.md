## Vaid et al. approach
The implementing of the Vaid et al. approach can be found in the folder script. 
The identified genes can be found in the file results/original_method/PROseq/PROseq.data.tsv.
The identified enhancers can be found in the file results/altered_method/from_joint_peak.
The pairs found by combinding all enhancers with all genes in results/altered_method/pairs. The result file containing the pairs found with UMAP was too large to upload to Github.
The pairs found with the nearest distance method is found in results/altered_method/pairs/nearest_distance.
