Regulates dosage compensation in females by suppressing hyperactivation of X-linked genes. Expression of the embryo-specific isoform is under the control of primary sex-determining signal, which depends on the ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes (X:A ratio). Expression occurs in 2X:2A cells, but not in X:2A cells. The X:A ratio seems to be signaled by the relative concentration of the X-linked transcription factors SIS-A and SIS-B. As a result, the embryo-specific product is expressed early only in female embryos and specifies female-adult specific splicing; in the male where it is not expressed, the default splicing gives rise to a truncated non-functional protein.

Switches between a cytoplasmic GDP- and a nuclear GTP-bound state by nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis. Nuclear import receptors such as importin beta bind their substrates only in the absence of GTP-bound RAN and release them upon direct interaction with GTP-bound RAN, while export receptors behave in the opposite way. Thereby, RAN controls cargo loading and release by transport receptors in the proper compartment and ensures the directionality of the transport. Interaction with RANBP1 induces a conformation change in the complex formed by XPO1 and RAN that triggers the release of the nuclear export signal of cargo proteins. RAN (GTP-bound form) triggers microtubule assembly at mitotic chromosomes and is required for normal mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation.

At the start of transcription, a single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned within the central active site cleft of Pol II. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. During transcription elongation, Pol II moves on the template as the transcript elongates.

The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823, PubMed:25512509). The function of GATOR1 in negatively regulating the TORC1 pathway is essential for maintaining baseline levels of TORC1 activity under nutrient rich conditions, and for promoting survival during amino acid or complete starvation by inhibiting TORC1-dependent cell growth and promoting catabolic metabolism and autophagy (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823). In addition, this inhibition of TORC1 is necessary to maintain female fertility under normal conditions and during periods of nutrient stress (PubMed:24786828, PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509). After exactly four mitotic cyst divisions, the GATOR1 complex members (Iml1, Nprl2 and Nprl3) down-regulate TORC1 to slow cellular metabolism and promote the mitotic/meiotic transition (PubMed:25512509). At later stages of oogenesis, the mio and Nup44A components of the GATOR2 complex inhibit GATOR1 and thus activate TORC1 to promote meiotic progression, and drive oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509).</ul>			NM_132946.3	NP_573174.1	32677

The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:27166823, PubMed:23723238). GATOR2 activates the TORC1 signaling pathway through the inhibition of the GATOR1 subcomplex, controlling the switch to cell proliferation and growth under nutrient replete conditions and during female oocyte development (PubMed:21521741, PubMed:25512509, PubMed:14973288, PubMed:23723238). This component is required for activating TORC1 specifically in germline cells to promote cell growth and maintain the oocyte fate (PubMed:27166823, PubMed:21521741, PubMed:23723238). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:21521741, PubMed:25512509, PubMed:14973288, PubMed:23723238). After exactly four mitotic cyst divisions, the GATOR1 complex members (Iml1, Nprl2 and Nprl3) down-regulate TORC1 to slow cellular metabolism and promote the mitotic/meiotic transition (PubMed:25512509). At later stages of oogenesis, the mio and Nup44A components of the GATOR2 complex inhibit GATOR1 and thus activate TORC1 to promote meiotic progression, and drive oocyte growth and development (PubMed:21521741, PubMed:25512509). In addition to its role in the regulation of the TORC1 complex, functions independently of TORC1 to prevent the inappropriate accumulation of autolysosomes in germline tissues (PubMed:27166823).</ul>			NM_134812.3	NP_608656.1	33399

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling.

Wg signaling operates by inactivating the sgg repression of engrailed autoactivation. Wg and Wnt2 have a role in the developing trachea and together are responsible for all dorsal trunk formation. Wg also acts in the developing epidermis. Acts as a morphogen, and diffuses long distances despite its lipidation. Lipophorin is required for diffusion, probably by acting as vehicle for its movement, explaining how it can spread over long distances despite its lipidation. In non-neuronal cells, wls directs wg secretion via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the retromer complex (a conserved protein complex consisting of Vps26 and Vps35) to sustain a wls traffic loop encompassing the Golgi, the cell surface, an endocytic compartment and a retrograde route leading back to the Golgi. In neuronal cells (the larval motorneuron NMJ), wg signal moves across the synapse through the release of wls-containing exosome-like vesicles.</ul>			NM_078778.5	NP_523502.1	34009

In the complex, acts to enhance the binding of the transcriptional activator REPTOR to the regulatory sequences of target genes. Under normal conditions TORC1 is active, inhibiting the formation of the REPTOR/REPTOR-BP complex by phosphorylating REPTOR and mediates its cytoplasmic retention by forming a docking site for 14-3-3 proteins. Upon TORC1 inhibition resulting from nutrient stress, REPTOR is recruited into the nucleus where it interacts with REPTOR-BP and together they maintain organismal metabolism by activating the expression of target stress response genes including those involved in glycogenesis and triglyceride biosynthesis.

Directly binds piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements (PubMed:16882972). In ovarian somatic cells, mediates silencing of transposable elements at the transcriptional level in a mael-dependent manner (PubMed:23159368, PubMed:28472469). Involved in silencing of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in male germline (PubMed:15817569). In testis, regulates spermatogenesis together with Tudor-SN (PubMed:26808625). In germ cells, mediates silencing at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and is involved in the maintenance of populations of primary and secondary piRNAs. Piwi-mediated transcriptional silencing is accompanied by the formation of His3 'Lys-9' trimethylated (H3K9me3) euchromatin and heterochromatin (PubMed:23434410, PubMed:23392610). In ovary, associates predominantly with antisense piRNAs that contain uridine at their 5' end. Association with sense piRNAs is also observed but to a lesser extent. Mediates a somatic signaling mechanism required for the maintenance of germline stem cells to produce and maintain a daughter germline stem cell (PubMed:9851978, PubMed:10631171, PubMed:9199372, PubMed:16949822). It is not essential for the further differentiation of the committed daughter cell (PubMed:9851978). Acts cell autonomously to promote germline stem cell division (PubMed:9851978, PubMed:10631171). Its role in stem cell maintenance does not seem to require nuclear localization. Required maternally for the posterior localization of osk and vas and for pole cell formation during oogenesis and early embryogenesis (PubMed:16949822). Together with Hop and Hsp83, mediates canalization, also known as developmental robustness, likely via epigenetic silencing of existing genetic variants and suppression of transposon-induced new genetic variation (PubMed:21186352). Shows RNA cleavage activity, although is not required for any of its known functions (PubMed:9199372, PubMed:16882972, PubMed:23297219). In the ovaries, forms a complex with nxf2, Panx and Nxt1 which acts as effectors of cotranscriptional transposon silencing (PubMed:31368590, PubMed:31384064).</ul>			NM_001298896.1, NM_057527.4	NP_476875.1, NP_001285825.1	34521

In ovary, associates predominantly with antisense piRNAs that contain uridine at their 5' end. In testis, associates with Su(Ste) antisense piRNAs (most abundant class of piRNAs found in complex with aub in testes) and negatively regulates Ste expression, most likely by cleaving its transcripts. Also in testis, may repress translation of vas when associated with a piRNA derived from chromosome X, termed AT-chX-1, whose sequence shows strong complementarity to vas mRNA. Aub-piRNA complexes from ovary and testis possess RNA cleavage activity. Involved in telomere regulation by repressing specialized telomeric retroelements HeT-A and TART; Drosophila telomeres being maintained by transposition of specialized telomeric retroelements. Also involved in telomeric trans-silencing, a repression mechanism by which a transposon or a transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous transposon, or transgene located in euchromatin. Involved in the suppression of meiotic drive of sex chromosomes and autosomes. Involved in transposon silencing in the adult brain. Required for dorsal-ventral as well as anterior-posterior patterning of the egg. Required during oogenesis for primordial germ cell formation and activation of RNA interference. During early oogenesis, required for osk mRNA silencing and polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. During mid-oogenesis, required for osk mRNA localization to the posterior pole and efficient translation of osk and grk. During embryogenesis, required for posterior localization of nos mRNA, independently of osk, and pole cell formation. Essential for the formation and/or structural integrity of perinuclear nuage particles. Required for the localization of Mael to the meiotic nuage. Forms a complex with smg, twin, AGO3 and specific piRNAs that targets nos mRNA (and probably other maternal mRNAS) for deadenylation promoting its decay during early embryogenesis.</ul>			NM_001103674.3, NM_057386.5	NP_001097144.1, NP_476734.1	34524

Affects the timing of neuronal cell differentiation (PubMed:15454083). Hyperactivation of the signaling leads to accelerated differentiation, whereas inhibition of the signaling retards differentiation (PubMed:15454083). Thus, in addition to controlling growth of the cell in which it resides, it can also influence growth of distant cells and organs during development via a humoral mechanism (PubMed:14505573). As part of the TORC1 complex regulates energy homeostasis and promotes certain aspects of larval growth by negatively regulating REPTOR (PubMed:25920570). REPTOR functions downstream of TORC1 to regulate the expression of stress response genes in response to TORC1 inhibition resulting from nutrient deprivation (PubMed:25920570). When TORC1 activity is high it phosphorylates REPTOR which inhibits its recruitment into the nucleus and antagonizes their function (PubMed:25920570). This function is essential under normal feeding conditions to promote TORC1-dependent growth during larval development and, in adults and larvae to prevent the REPTOR-dependent expression of nutrient stress response genes (PubMed:25920570). In short, during development, it primarily controls growth, whereas in the adult, where there is relatively little growth, it controls aging and other aspects of nutrient-related physiology (PubMed:11069885, PubMed:11069888, PubMed:19211682, PubMed:19225150).

Plays a role in gastrulation/germ band extension, hindgut morphogenesis, positive regulation of cell proliferation, genital disk development and pattern formation. Acts as a key regulator of the Hox gene network and activates transcription via the downstream core promoter element (DPE) relative to the TATA box. Plays a role in the establishment of the hindgut and in the invagination of the hindgut primordium during gastrulation. These effects on the gut are achieved by acting combinatorially at the posterior of the embryo to activate transcription of different targets including fog, fkh and wg. Caudal is involved in regulation of proliferation through transactivation of the E2F gene.

This function is essential for preventing excessive degradation and turnover of vesicles from the readily releasable pool which leads to increased neurotransmission and eventually neurodegeneration (PubMed:21458671, PubMed:25422373, PubMed:27669036).

Part of a rhi-dependent transcription machinery that enables the generation of piRNA precursors from heterochromatin while maintaining the suppression of transposon-encoded promoters and enhancers (PubMed:28847004). Component of the RDC complex (rhi, del and cuff) which binds to repressive H3K9me3 marks in the piRNA clusters (PubMed:28847004). RDC promotes the bidirectional transcription of piRNA clusters at these sites by interacting with Moonshiner which forms a complex with the transcription initiation factors TfIIA-S and Trf2 (PubMed:28847004). This mechanism allows transcription to occur in piRNA clusters despite the lack of proper promoter elements and in the presence of the repressive H3K9me3 mark (PubMed:28847004).</ul>			NM_001273737.1, NM_136247.3	NP_001260666.1, NP_610091.2	35380

DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.</ul>			NM_001032164.2, NM_001032184.2, NM_001032139.2, NM_001032179.2, NM_001032159.2, NM_001032116.2, NM_001032214.2, NM_001032120.2, NM_001032129.2, NM_001032204.2, NM_001032125.2, NM_165381.4, NM_001032189.2, NM_001032194.2, NM_001032199.2, NM_001032174.2, NM_001032154.2, NM_001032149.2, NM_001032209.2, NM_001032112.2, NM_001032134.2, NM_001032144.2, NM_001032169.2	NP_001027350.1, NP_001027300.1, NP_001027305.1, NP_001027370.1, NP_001027296.1, NP_001027315.1, NP_001027345.1, NP_001027283.1, NP_001027375.1, NP_001027365.1, NP_001027335.1, NP_001027355.1, NP_001027310.1, NP_001027287.1, NP_001027360.1, NP_001027320.1, NP_724342.1, NP_001027330.1, NP_001027380.1, NP_001027325.1, NP_001027385.1, NP_001027291.1, NP_001027340.1	3772271, 3772013, 3771957, 3772099, 3772265, 3772299, 3772083, 3772104, 3772264, 3772496, 3771891, 3772276, 3772094, 3772203, 3772575, 3772166, 3772058, 3772502, 3771809, 3772081, 3772336, 326273, 3772248

The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:27166823, PubMed:23723238, PubMed:25512509). GATOR2 activates the TORC1 signaling pathway through the inhibition of the GATOR1 subcomplex, controlling the switch to cell proliferation growth under nutrient replete conditions and growth during female oocyte development (PubMed:21521741, PubMed:25512509, PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823). This component is required for activating TORC1 specifically in germline cells to promote cell growth and maintain the oocyte fate, probably influences the organization and/or function of microtubules within ovarian cysts, and promotes accumulation of another GATOR2 complex member mio in germline and somatic tissues (PubMed:27166823, PubMed:23723238, PubMed:25512509, PubMed:21521741). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509). After exactly four mitotic cyst divisions, the GATOR1 complex members (Iml1, Nprl2 and Nprl3) down-regulate TORC1 to slow cellular metabolism and promote the mitotic/meiotic transition (PubMed:25512509). At later stages of oogenesis, the mio and Nup44A components of the GATOR2 complex inhibit GATOR1 and thus activate TORC1 to promote meiotic progression, and drive oocyte growth and development (PubMed:21521741, PubMed:25512509). In addition to its role in the regulation of the TORC1 complex, functions independently of TORC1 to prevent the inappropriate accumulation of autolysosomes in germline tissues (PubMed:27166823).</ul>			NM_165583.2, NM_136499.3, NM_165582.2	NP_724638.1, NP_724637.1, NP_610343.1	35762

Plays a role in chromosomal organization and gene expression regulation; stimulates transcription by promoting the formation of an open chromatin environment (PubMed:12027452, PubMed:20174442). Binds chromatin to nucleoporin-associated regions (NARs) that define transcriptionally active regions of the genome (PubMed:20174442). Associates with extended chromosomal regions that alternate between domains of high density binding with those of low occupancy (PubMed:20174442). Preferentially binds to NARs of the male X chromosome (PubMed:20174442). In males, together with Nup153, required for the localization of the male-specific lethal (MSL) histone acetyltransferase complex to the X chromosome and therefore for the transcription of dosage compensation genes (PubMed:16543150). During mitosis forms a gel-like spindle matrix complex together with Skeletor, Chro, east, and Asator embedding the microtubule spindle apparatus (PubMed:15356261, PubMed:15962301, PubMed:19273613, PubMed:22855526). Promotes assembly of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensuring a timely and effective recruitment of spindle checkpoint proteins like Mad2 and Mps1 to unattached kinetochore during the metaphase-anaphase transition before chromosome congression (PubMed:19273613, PubMed:26714316). In testes, has a role in stem cell asymmetric division and maintenance via regulation of mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex (PubMed:26714316).</ul>			NM_001273974.1, NM_057719.4	NP_477067.2, NP_001260903.1	36264

During late cytokinesis, central spindle asymmetry is generated by enrichment of Patronin on the pIIb side which protects microtubules from depolymerization by Klp10A while unprotected microtubules on the pIIa side are disassembled by Klp10A, leading to the asymmetric delivery of Sara-expressing endosomes to the pIIa daughter cell (PubMed:26659188).</ul>			NM_176218.3, NM_206153.3, NM_206154.3	NP_788398.1, NP_995875.1, NP_995876.1	36978

Functions as an adapter protein that transduces immunity signals from the activation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) by bacterial infection to the Imd signaling pathway (PubMed:7568155, PubMed:11269502, PubMed:11703941, PubMed:12433364, PubMed:20122400). Binding of diaminopimelic acid-type (DAP-type) bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN) causes multimerization or clustering of PGRP receptors which activate the Imd cascade probably by recruiting imd, Fadd and Dredd to the receptor complex (PubMed:11269502, PubMed:12433364, PubMed:20122400). Once in proximity, Dredd cleaves imd in a Fadd-dependent manner to enable its association and activation by the ubiquitin E3-ligase DIAP2 (PubMed:20122400). The activated form of imd recruits and activates the Tab2/Tak1 complex thus acting upstream of the IKK complex (ird5 and key) to activate Rel and induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides such as Def, Dpt and Cecropin (PubMed:7568155, PubMed:8808632, PubMed:11703941, PubMed:12433364, PubMed:19837371, PubMed:20122400, PubMed:11266367).

Insulators have two defining properties; they can block the communication between an enhancer and a promoter when placed between them, and can also buffer transgenes from position effect variegation (PEV). Insulators are proposed to structure the chromatin fiber into independent domains of differing transcriptional potential by promoting the formation of distinct chromatin loops. This chromatin looping may require the formation of insulator bodies, where homotypic interactions between individual subunits of the insulator complex could promote the clustering of widely spaced insulators at the nuclear periphery. Within the gypsy insulator complex, this protein may promote formation of nuclear insulator bodies by recruiting individual insulator complexes to the nuclear lamina.</ul>			NM_001274154.1, NM_137544.3	NP_611388.1, NP_001261083.1	37188

Functions downstream of the two chemoattractant receptors, Pvr and Egfr, to promote BC adhesion between the leader cells of the migrating cluster and the surrounding nurse cells (PubMed:24855950). This adhesion increases Rac1 signaling in the leading cells, which in turn stabilizes DE-cadherin/DE-cadherin adhesions through the formation of forward-directed protrusions which attach/detach to the surrounding nurse cells in order to pull the cluster through the egg chamber to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950). Within the BC cluster, also promotes adhesion between BCs, and between BCs and polar cells which enables the lead BC to communicate direction to the other cells in the cluster, providing polarity to each individual cell and ensuring collective behavior (PubMed:24855950, PubMed:30763317). May function in cell intercalation in the lateral epidermis during germband extension (PubMed:24681004).

Known ligands include spitz, gurken, vein and giant-lens (PubMed:9882502, PubMed:22140578, PubMed:19718021, PubMed:20723758). Transduces the signal through the ras-raf-MAPK pathway (PubMed:9094709). Critical for the proliferation of imaginal tissues, and for the determination of both the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral polarities of the oocyte (PubMed:9882502, PubMed:23579691). In the embryo, plays a role in the establishment of ventral cell fates, maintenance of amnioserosa and ventral neuroectodermal cells, germ band retraction, cell fate specification in the central nervous system, and production and repair of the cuticle (PubMed:22140578, PubMed:23579691, PubMed:9094709). During dorsal closure (DC) functions with the dpp- and ACK-signaling pathways to regulate expression of the myosin zip in the embryonic epidermis and amnioserosa (AS), and thus coordinate the progression of epidermal cell shape changes required for correct DC (PubMed:23579691). In the embryonic epidermis, functions by negatively regulating dpp and consequently the dpp-dependent expression of the myosin zip (PubMed:23579691). In the AS, negatively regulates the production/ and or secretion of a diffusible signal which, is produced by the ACK-signaling pathway, and acts in the AS and epidermal cells to promote zip expression (PubMed:23579691). Also required in the AS to inhibit or delay apoptosis, and consequently slow the rate of DC (PubMed:23579691). Therefore functions at multiple levels to negatively regulate morphogenesis during DC, suggesting that it acts as a general brake mechanism for adjusting the rate of dorsal closure to ensure that closure proceeds smoothly and without loss of epidermal integrity (PubMed:23579691). During oogenesis, one of two tyrosine kinase chemoattractant receptors (Egfr and Pvr), that function in the border cells (BC) to detect guidance cues from the oocyte and transduce this information to the guidance pathway that regulate the collective migration of the BC cluster through the nurse cells to the oocyte (PubMed:24855950).</ul>			NM_057411.4	NP_476759.1	37455

Acts with Nup98-96 to promote the nuclear export of specific mRNAs such as Moe, however it does not appear to be required for general nuclear mRNA transport (PubMed:14729268, PubMed:28554770). Essential mitotic and male meiotic cell cycle regulator with roles in many aspects of the cell cycle including chromatin organization and condensation, spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and maintaining nuclear structure (PubMed:23788425, PubMed:14729268, PubMed:27494403). During male meiosis it is required for completion of meiosis I, as well as accurate cytokinesis of the secondary spermatocytes, and postmeiotic differentiation of spermatids (PubMed:23788425). Acts as a downstream regulatory target of the Hippo/SWH (Sav/Wts/Hpo) signaling pathway to promote mitotic cell cycle progression and proliferation during wing and eye development, and thereby plays a key role in integrating the regulation of proliferation with organ size control (PubMed:27494403, PubMed:14729268). When the Hippo/SWH signaling pathway is inactive, Rae1 acts independently of yki to increase organ size by promoting mitotic S-phase entry and increase cellular proliferation (PubMed:27494403). When the Hippo/SWH signaling pathway is active it inhibits the activity of Rae1 in a Wts-dependent manner to restrict organ growth (PubMed:27494403). However, Rae1 is also able to negatively regulate the levels and activity of yki likely by activating the core kinases of the Hippo/SWH signaling pathway hpo and Wts and increasing the protein levels of hpo, Mer and Wts; it is therefore likely that it functions as part of a negative feedback loop with the Hippo/SWH signaling pathway to regulate pathway homeostasis and prevent organ overgrowth (PubMed:27494403). Promotes mitotic cell cycle progression, at least in part, by increasing the accumulation of mitotic cyclins such as CycB, possibly by directly upregulating cyclin transcripts or by inhibiting the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activator fzy (PubMed:27494403). Also required in presynaptic, postmitotic motor neurons to restrain synaptic terminal growth (PubMed:21874015). Promotes the expression and stability of the an E3 ubiquitin ligase of hiw, and is likely to function in the regulation of synaptic growth by binding to hiw and protecting it from autophagy-mediated degradation (PubMed:21874015).</ul>			NM_137753.3	NP_611597.1	37467

The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509). The function of GATOR1 in negatively regulating the TORC1 pathway is essential for maintaining baseline levels of TORC1 activity under nutrient rich conditions, and for promoting survival during amino acid or complete starvation by inhibiting TORC1-dependent cell growth and promoting catabolic metabolism and autophagy (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509).

Binds to the ligand prtp which relocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface during apoptosis (PubMed:19927123, PubMed:23337816). Ligand-binding may promote tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src42a, interaction with shark and subsequent activation of phagocytosis (PubMed:18432193). Also binds to the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine which is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells (PubMed:23420848). Required for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages (PubMed:15342648). Also required for the phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons by glial cells in the embryonic nervous system (PubMed:12765609). Acts downstream of NimC4/simu in the glial phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons (PubMed:18455990). Plays a role in the glial engulfment of larval axons as part of programmed axon pruning during metamorphosis (PubMed:16772168, PubMed:16772170). Also mediates glial cell clearance of severed axons following axonal injury (PubMed:16772169, PubMed:27498858). Required for the engulfment of degenerating dendrites by epidermal cells (PubMed:24412417). Required in the ovary for the engulfment and subsequent processing of dying germline cells by follicular epithelial cells through activation of the JNK/bsk pathway (PubMed:22992958, PubMed:27347682). Plays a role in neuromuscular junction development by mediating the clearance of presynaptic debris and immature boutons which are shed by growing synapses (PubMed:19707574). Required for larval salivary gland cell death which occurs following a rise in steroid levels after puparium formation (PubMed:20577216). Also involved in bacterial phagocytosis (PubMed:18984163). Required for hemocyte phagocytosis of the Gram-positive bacterium S.aureus (PubMed:19890048). Lipoteichoic acid, synthesized by the S.aureus lipoteichoic acid synthase ltaS, acts as a ligand for drpr in this process (PubMed:19890048). Together with Src42a and shark, promotes the migration of macrophages to sites of wounding as part of a signaling cascade where Scr42a detects production of hydrogen peroxide at wound sites which triggers phosphorylation of drpr and subsequent recruitment and activation of shark (PubMed:26028435). Also required for macrophage priming which occurs following phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and ensures that macrophages develop a form of molecular memory that allows them to later mount an inflammatory response to tissue damage and bacterial infection (PubMed:27212238). Is also an essential factor in the regulation of muscle development and myogenesis, and as a consequence is required for normal locomotion (PubMed:12765609, PubMed:25111228, Ref.27).

This innate olfactory avoidance behavior can be inhibited by inhibitory interactions of the odors such as 1-hexanol and 2,3-butanedione with Gr21a and Gr63a.</ul>			NM_001144411.1	NP_001137883.1	38453

In NER, TFIIH acts by opening DNA around the lesion to allow the excision of the damaged oligonucleotide and its replacement by a new DNA fragment. The ATPase activity of haywire/XPB/ERCC3, but not its helicase activity, is required for DNA opening. In transcription, TFIIH has an essential role in transcription initiation.

The two GATOR subcomplexes, GATOR1 and GATOR2, regulate the TORC1 pathway in order to mediate metabolic homeostasis, female gametogenesis and the response to amino acid limitation and complete starvation (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823, PubMed:25512509). The function of GATOR1 in negatively regulating the TORC1 pathway is essential for maintaining baseline levels of TORC1 activity under nutrient rich conditions, and for promoting survival during amino acid or complete starvation by inhibiting TORC1-dependent cell growth and promoting catabolic metabolism and autophagy (PubMed:23723238, PubMed:27166823). In addition, this inhibition of TORC1 is necessary to maintain female fertility under normal conditions and during periods of nutrient stress (PubMed:24786828, PubMed:27672113, PubMed:25512509). GATOR1 and GATOR2 act at different stages of oogenesis to regulate TORC1 in order to control meiotic entry and promote oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509). After exactly four mitotic cyst divisions, the GATOR1 complex members (Iml1, Nprl2 and Nprl3) down-regulate TORC1 to slow cellular metabolism and promote the mitotic/meiotic transition (PubMed:25512509). At later stages of oogenesis, the mio and Nup44A components of the GATOR2 complex inhibit GATOR1 and thus activate TORC1 to promote meiotic progression, and drive oocyte growth and development (PubMed:25512509).</ul>			NM_001274889.1, NM_140423.3, NM_168570.1	NP_648680.2, NP_729945.1, NP_001261818.1	39550

The Esc/E(z) complex is necessary but not sufficient for the repression of homeotic target genes, suggesting that the recruitment of the distinct PRC1 complex is also required.</ul>			NM_143802.3, NM_168826.2	NP_652059.1, NP_730465.1	48071

In various developing tissues functions as a cell cycle regulator that mediates cell proliferation according to the requirements of the developmental program (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871). Acts by inducing the proteasomal degradation of the CD25 mitotic activators stg and twe at critical stages of development to delay entry into mitosis and thus mediate cell proliferation (PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494, PubMed:10837248, PubMed:15581871, PubMed:23290551, PubMed:29025897). During gastrulation, negatively regulates stg to delay mitosis in the ventral region of the embryonic mesoderm thus allowing invagination to be completed before cell division takes place (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:10850494). Delaying stg-dependent mitosis during bristle development and in migrating germline pole cells also arrests their cell divisions, whereas in cystocytes it promotes their cell divisions (PubMed:10837248, PubMed:10850493, PubMed:15581871). Involved in the regulation of the mid-blastula transition; promotes the destruction of twe resulting in the cell cycle arrest in G2 of cycle 14 which delays mitosis and thus reduces cell proliferation allowing cell fate specification and morphogenesis to take place (PubMed:23290551). In germline cells, blocks border cell migration during oogenesis by binding to slbo/C/EBP and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:23305818, PubMed:10949024, PubMed:29025897). May function in a negative feedback loop with slbo to coordinate proper border cell migration (PubMed:23305818). During tissue growth negatively regulates insulin signaling by binding to Akt1 and blocking its phosphorylation-dependent activation (PubMed:25329475, PubMed:29025897). However it may also function downstream in the insulin signaling pathway, acting with Akt1 to direct foxo degradation (PubMed:25329475). Essential for the proper formation of operant place and aversive olfactory memories (PubMed:18430923, PubMed:28669782).</ul>			NM_079933.4	NP_524672.1	43999

Inserts one or 2 nucleotide(s) opposite the lesion (PubMed:11297519). During homologous recombination (HR) repair, has a overlapping role with the error-prone translesion polymerase DNApol-zeta/DNApolZ1 to initiate repair synthesis that is completed by end joining or another polymerase that can bind and reinitiate synthesis (PubMed:22532806). Particularly important for the repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers and for hydroxyurea (HU)-induced DNA damage (PubMed:22532806, PubMed:24553286). Although inserts the correct base, may cause base transitions and transversions depending upon the context (By similarity). Forms a Schiff base with 5'-deoxyribose phosphate at abasic sites, but does not have any lyase activity, preventing the release of the 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (5'-dRP) residue (By similarity). This covalent trapping of the enzyme by the 5'-dRP residue inhibits its DNA synthetic activity during base excision repair, thereby avoiding high incidence of mutagenesis (By similarity).</ul>			NM_141114.3	NP_649371.2	40438

In testis, however, associates with Su(Ste) and AT-chX-1 piRNAs mostly produced from antisense precursors. Shows RNA cleavage activity. In the germline, acts to amplify pools of antisense piRNAs, among others Su(Ste), AT-chX-1 and roo, and to limit sense piRNA accumulation. Forms a complex with smg, twin, aub and specific piRNAs that targets nos mRNA (and probably other maternal mRNAS) for deadenylation promoting its decay during early embryogenesis. Involved in transposon silencing in the adult brain.</ul>			NM_001043163.3, NM_001170027.2, NM_001043162.3, NM_001043164.3	NP_001163498.1, NP_001036628.2, NP_001036629.2, NP_001036627.2	3355150

NPF neurons coordinately modulate diverse sensory and motor neurons important for feeding, flight, and locomotion. NPF/NPFR pathway exerts its suppressive effect on larval aversion to diverse stressful stimuli (chemical stress and noxious heat) through attenuation of TRP channel-induced neuronal excitation. NPF neural signaling system plays a physiological role in acute modulation of alcohol sensitivity in adults, rather than a general response to intoxication by sedative agents. Activation and inhibition of the NPF system reduces and enhances ethanol preference, respectively. Sexual experience, the NPF system activity and ethanol consumption are all linked; sexual deprivation is a major contributor to enhanced ethanol preference.</ul>			NM_079521.4, NM_001260017.2	NP_001246946.1, NP_524245.3	40754

Plays a role in different DNA repair pathways such as DNA strand cross-link repair and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), an alternative non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery triggered in response to double-strand breaks (PubMed:20936147, PubMed:20617203, PubMed:28542210). MMEJ is an error-prone repair pathway that produces deletions of sequences from the strand being repaired and promotes genomic rearrangements, such as telomere fusions (PubMed:20617203). Utilizes short microhomologies present in partially and fully single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as primers for DNA synthesis (PubMed:28542210). Prefers poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a template-primer (PubMed:10343651). The ATPase activity is necessary during interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair and has a critical role in generating templated insertions during MMEJ (PubMed:28542210). Necessary for processing DNA damage induced by oxygen and N-ethylation (PubMed:10732683, PubMed:20936147). In follicle cells, contributes to double-strand break repair at physiological rereplication forks necessary for survival of fertilized eggs (PubMed:20936147, PubMed:27849606).</ul>			NM_079609.3	NP_524333.1	41571

Chromatin insulators are regulatory elements which establish independent domains of transcriptional activity within eukaryotic genomes. Insulators have two defining properties; they can block the communication between an enhancer and a promoter when placed between them and can also buffer transgenes from position effect variegation (PEV). Insulators are proposed to structure the chromatin fiber into independent domains of differing transcriptional potential by promoting the formation of distinct chromatin loops. This chromatin looping may involve the formation of insulator bodies, where homotypic interactions between individual subunits of the insulator complex could promote the clustering of widely spaced insulators at the nuclear periphery. Within the gypsy insulator complex, this protein binds specifically to a region of the gypsy element located 3' of the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), and may also mediate interaction with other endogenous insulators at sites distinct from those recognized by Cp190.</ul>			NM_079625.3, NM_169574.2, NM_001260169.2	NP_001247098.1, NP_731897.1, NP_524349.1	41740

DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.</ul>			NM_001032201.1, NM_001032136.2, NM_001032156.2, NM_001032171.2, NM_001032122.2, NM_001032131.2, NM_001032126.2, NM_001032141.2, NM_001032186.2, NM_001275647.1, NM_001032113.2, NM_001032176.2, NM_079628.4, NM_169593.3, NM_001032117.2, NM_001032211.1, NM_001032191.2, NM_001032151.2, NM_001032166.2, NM_001032146.2, NM_001032206.1, NM_001032161.2, NM_169592.3, NM_165383.3, NM_001032181.2, NM_001032196.1	NP_001027312.1, NP_001027342.1, NP_001027337.1, NP_001027297.1, NP_001027377.1, NP_001027347.1, NP_001027322.1, NP_001027284.1, NP_001027367.1, NP_001027332.1, NP_001027307.1, NP_524352.1, NP_001027302.1, NP_731927.1, NP_001027293.1, NP_001027362.1, NP_731928.1, NP_001027327.1, NP_724344.1, NP_001027357.1, NP_001027352.1, NP_001027372.1, NP_001027382.1, NP_001027317.1, NP_001262576.1, NP_001027288.1	3771908, 3772211, 3771938, 3771854, 318846, 3772325, 3772113, 3771947, 3772314, 3772096, 3771941, 3772317, 3772519, 3772708, 3772172, 3772509, 3772319, 3772666, 3772254, 3772129, 3771893, 41773, 3771935

Hydrolysis of GTP and release of Pi, which makes GTP hydrolysis irreversible, causes the release of the eIF-2-GDP binary complex from the 40S subunit, an event that is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form an elongation-competent 80S ribosome. In order for eIF-2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF-2 must be exchanged with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEF) eIF-2B.</ul>			NM_001275658.1, NM_169629.2, NM_169630.2	NP_731994.1, NP_731993.1, NP_001262587.1	41843

Chromatin insulators are regulatory elements which establish independent domains of transcriptional activity within eukaryotic genomes. Insulators have two defining properties; they can block the communication between an enhancer and a promoter when placed between them and can also buffer transgenes from position effect variegation (PEV). Insulators are proposed to structure the chromatin fiber into independent domains of differing transcriptional potential by promoting the formation of distinct chromatin loops. This chromatin looping may involve the formation of insulator bodies, where homotypic interactions between individual subunits of the insulator complex could promote the clustering of widely spaced insulators at the nuclear periphery. Within the gypsy insulator complex, this protein may directly bind to insulator DNA at sites distinct from those recognized by su(Hw). Required during embryogenesis for axial expansion, an actin/myosin dependent process that distributes the dividing nuclei along the anterior-posterior axis of the syncytial embryo.

During the S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA polymerase alpha complex (composed of a catalytic subunit POLA1/p180, an accessory subunit POLA2/p70 and two primase subunits, the catalytic subunit PRIM1/p49 and the regulatory subunit PRIM2/p58) is recruited to DNA at the replicative forks (PubMed:9858578, PubMed:6773966, PubMed:6806812, PubMed:6409898). The primase subunit of the polymerase alpha complex initiates DNA synthesis by oligomerising short RNA primers on both leading and lagging strands (By similarity). These primers are initially extended by the polymerase alpha catalytic subunit and subsequently transferred to polymerase delta and polymerase epsilon for processive synthesis on the lagging and leading strand, respectively (By similarity).
